# Mundo Informa√ß√£o

Welcome to the Mundo Informa√ß√£o GitHub repository! This project originated as a school assignment aimed at creating a bibliographic resource for each section of a presentation. The primary objectives were to gain familiarity with NEXT.js and to provide an alternative to paid linktree applications.
## Key Features:

    Bibliographic Resources: Mundo Informa√ß√£o serves as a comprehensive bibliographic repository, organizing resources corresponding to different sections of a presentation. Users can easily access relevant sources and references for further exploration and study.

    Built with NEXT.js: The project leverages the power of NEXT.js, a popular React framework for building server-rendered applications. Through this technology, Mundo Informa√ß√£o offers a dynamic and interactive user experience.

    Cost-effective Alternative: By creating a custom solution rather than relying on paid linktree applications, Mundo Informa√ß√£o demonstrates a cost-effective approach to organizing and sharing resources online.

## Usage:

Whether you're a student seeking to organize bibliographic references for a presentation or a developer looking to explore NEXT.js capabilities, Mundo Informa√ß√£o offers valuable insights and practical examples. Feel free to explore the codebase, experiment with its features, and adapt the project to suit your specific needs.
Note:

Mundo Informa√ß√£o was developed as a school project and serves as both a learning exercise and a functional resource. While it may have originated as an academic assignment, the project's utility extends beyond the classroom, providing a practical solution for organizing and sharing bibliographic information.
